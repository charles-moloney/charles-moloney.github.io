               The is no such thing as a perfect home page. As the part of your website that recieves far and away the most traffic,
               everyone who has a stake in your website is vying for some real-estate on your front page. As a result, a homepage 
               should be a compromise, focusing on the key elements of your website. You will likely need to include:
               <br>
               <br>1. Site identity and mission
               <br>2. Site hierarchy
               <br>3. Search and navigation
               <br>4. Content promos
               <br>5. Timely/featured content
               <br>6. Any advertising/deals you have to show
               <br>7. Shortcuts
               <br>
               <br>This is a non exhausive list. You may also need sign-ins, settings, and other key features of your site.
               With so much to include, something will often give, and you must make sacrifices and understand what is necessary for 
               your website.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Let's take a look at the homepage of one of the web's most visited sites: YouTube. Note the lack of a mission
                statement -- only incredibly popular sites shoudl have this priveledge, as users should always be able to easily
                understand what your website is for just by looking at your homepage. Take note of how this page is laid out.
                Youtubers often long to be featured on the front page, as you can see the videos are front and center, taking up
                the majority of the page's real estate. YouTube manages to show you what you want while still using exactly enough
                space to include all key features. The clickable logo is in the top left, immediately letting you know the identity 
                of the site, and the search bar and navigation features are readily apparent across the top and left ribbons. There 
                is an option for settings and a sign-in, and users have access to all necessary utilities while still being able to 
                meander if they do so choose. It is inviting to new members and incredibly respectful towards and retains its usefulness
                for seasoned users.
