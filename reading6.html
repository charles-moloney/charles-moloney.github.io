                I need to rant for a litte. I just read one of the most interesting pieces yet in Leatrice Eiseman's "The Complete Color Harmony"
                for my User Interface Design class, but it was also one of the most infurating. Let's walk it through

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Do not get me wrong. The reading was overall not bad. I had a fantastic time reading about what different cultural associations
                with different colors are. These facts are real ones, and it's important to understand how different people percieve the use
                of color in my work to allow me to create more effective styles of communication. Did you know that the Japanese word for green
                ("midori") is in reference to a different default green/blue than what our green or blue is? I sure didn't before I read this section.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                While the first half of content we had from Eiseman for today was rooted in the culture significances of color, the second
                half threw all this out the window in favor of what are essentially horoscopes for your favorite color. I perhaps wouldn't be
                so mad if it didn't seem so off-base for me, but I was unable to relate to the content whatsoever. My favorite color is purple,
                but the book's description of someone who likes that color is nowhere near what I am actually like (my roommate Jake had the same
                problem with his favorite color of orange)! I feel these would be a lot better if they weren't so definite, and it made me have 
                a lot less faith than I did previously in the credibility of Leatrice and her assertions. SAD!
