            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">What have we learned this week?</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
               As of late, I have been spending a lot of time learning about various aspects, guidelines, and best practices when doing UX/UI design. This is all well and good,
               but the fact is: unless you can ace the interview for a UX/UI job, you won't get to ever use your skills in the first place. I interviewed earlier this year for 
               a UX position at Hudl and unfortunately did not make it in, and I wanted to improve my skills, so this week, I've been spending some time watching videos and 
               reading up on resources for acing the design interview. I especially enjoyed some of the insights provided by DesignWithArash and Mizko, and I'd like to share 
               some of what they taught me here. In no particular order, here are some tips and tricks I learned for acing the design interview: <br><br>

               1. Prepare some SOLID questions beforehand. <br>
               Everyone knows about how important your portfolio is and how you can answer the interviewer's questions in a job interview, but do not sleep on the power of good,
               quality questioning. If you can leave a good first impression and get them to answer thoughtful questions, it shifts the hot seat in the interview from them. Interviewers 
               will often place high value on someone they see as insightful, and, as a plus, you will also know more about the job and if it is good for you. <br>
               2. Custom tailor your portfolio <br>
               Not every design position is the same, and the job description will often contain information about key tasks you will have to perform for the company as a UX/UI designer.
               Before going into the interview, make sure your portfolio highlights best what you have done that meets that desciption. It will make your skillset look much stronger in the 
               eyes of the company <br>
               3. Make your thought process clear <br>
               The interviers don't just want to know what you say -- they also want to know what you are thinking and feeling. Vocalizing your thoughts, especially for something like a 
               whiteboard problem can make you appear as much stronger if you can come off as analytical and intelligent, even if your end product is not perfect. <br>
               4. Look for leverage and value yourself <br>
               REMEMBER: You are not just being interviwed by the company -- you are finding out if this job is right for you as well. Ask about salary, find out what the window on their 
               hiring schedule is, and look into the culture of the company. More often to not, the company may need you just as much as you need them, and you must value yourself in the 
               interview or you will not be valued in the eyes of the interviewer. Confidence is key, and make sure to stand your ground when you need to.
